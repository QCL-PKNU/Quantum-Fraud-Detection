# Quantum-Fraud-Detection

# Quantum for Credit Card Fraud Detection

This is the implementation of paper "Quantum Autoencoder for Fraud Detection". 




## Project Structure

Below is an overview of the project files and their purpose:

- `data.py`: Dataset is being preprocessed. 

- `circuits.py`: Defines the quantum circuit required to construct  proposed method including all necessary components.

- `lossfunctions.py`: Implementation of the loss functions.

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application. This script runs the proposed architecture. 

- `plot.py`: Provides a class to plot the roc_curve.

- `qae.py`:  Provides methods for training and inferencing.

- `utils.py`: Includes utility functions required for calculating the main metric of this work.



## Project setup

1. Dataset download [Credit card dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

2. Setup the environment 

3. Run the project 

```bash
  python main.py
```
